## Q11 revamped keymap with the following features:

- No mac support (only windows)
    - Mac/Win is switching SpongeBob mode
- 3 layers
    - one base layer + one for each fn buttton
- via support
- CAPS_WORD is enabled (with doubletap on shifts to enable)
- media control (volume up/down media previous / next) on right FN + arrow keys (resembles my K8 map)
- KC_END on right FN + home
